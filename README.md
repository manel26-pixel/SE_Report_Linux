# Linux System Programming - TP Reports

This repository contains a series of lab reports (Travaux Pratiques) written in French, focused on mastering the fundamentals and advanced concepts of Linux system usage and system programming using the C language.

## üìÅ Content Overview

### File TP_Num1
**Title:** *Fichiers, R√©pertoires, Permissions, Redirections & Liens*

This report covers:
- File and directory manipulation using terminal commands.
- Understanding absolute and relative paths.
- Managing file permissions using symbolic and octal modes.
- Using commands like `chmod`, `chown`, `umask`.
- Redirection and pipes (`>`, `>>`, `2>`, `|`).
- Archiving and compression with `tar` and `gzip`.
- Symbolic vs physical links (`ln -s`, `ln`).
- Command history, shell environment, and standard devices.
- File searching using patterns and wildcards.

### File TP_Num2
**Title:** *Commandes Linux de Base, Scripting Shell & Programmation C Simple*

This report introduces:
- Essential Linux commands: `echo`, `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, `man`, `whoami`, `history`, etc.
- Differences between console and graphical interface terminals.
- Introduction to text editors (`gedit`, `vim`).
- Writing and executing Shell scripts.
- Shell conditional statements and comparison operators.

### File TP_Num3
**Title:** *Appels Syst√®mes en Langage C (open, stat, chmod, etc.)*

This report focuses on low-level system programming in C:
- Using `open()` to create files with specific permissions.
- Understanding `umask` and its effect on permission defaults.
- Reading file metadata using `stat()` and `struct stat`.
- Displaying permissions, file types, user/group ownership, size, etc.
- Simulating the `ls -l` and `cp` commands via C programs.
- Verifying error handling when files already exist or are inaccessible.
- Creating simple command-line utilities using C and system calls.
